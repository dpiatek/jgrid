# jGrid Plugin

Switch on / off a grid overlay on your website.

## Getting Started
Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max].

[min]: https://raw.github.com/dpiatek/jgrid/master/dist/jquery.jGrid.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/dpiatek/jgrid/master/dist/jquery.jGrid.js

In your web page:

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.jGrid.min.js"></script>
```

And press Ctrl + Shift + L to show the grid.
Enter the container width, number of columns, gutter and margin-left and right.
The calculated column size will show on the left.

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!_
